## Install via npm

For most projects (and to take advantage of the customization features), you'll want to install Webpixels CSS and its peer-dependencies via npm.

```txt
npm install @webpixels/css@latest bootstrap@latest --save-dev
```

This will automatically install the latest Bootstrap version, so you don't need to do that manually.

## Create the Sass files

In your `scss` folder create two new files and name them:

- main.scss
- utility.scss

### Import the base styles and components

In your main.scss, you’ll import the source Sass files. Bootstrap is automatically loaded when you use the source files, so you don't need to worry about what Bootstrap files should you incorporate in your styles.

```scss
// Functions
@import "bootstrap/scss/functions";

// Main   
@import "@webpixels/css/main";
```

### Import the utility classes

In Webpixels CSS you'll notice that we don't create custom styles, but rather make use of the utility classes. We are using the new Bootstrap Utility API to generate a comprehensive list of classes.

In your utility.scss you'll import all the utilities:

```scss
@import "@webpixels/css/utility";
```
